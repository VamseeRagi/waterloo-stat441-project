4.1 Supervised learning
- try a bunch of models first with default parameters and for those that have reasonable prediction accuracy, use grid search and parameter tuning methods to yield better prediction
- models tried
	- logistic regression
	- tree methods
		- decision tree

4.2 Semi-supervised learning



------------------------
+ and -'s of each model:
------------------------

logistic regressions:
+ simple to implement
+ performs well as long as the classes are linear reparable
+ robust to noise
+ regularizations to prevent overfitting


Random forest:
+ easier to tune
+ robust to overfitting
+ generates an internal unbiased estimate of the generalization error as the forest building progresses


tree:
- might overfit


gradient boosting:
+ tries to find optimal linear combination of trees (assume final model is the weighted sum of predictions of individual trees) in relation to given train data
- Gradient Boosted Trees are more susceptible to jiggling data. This final stage makes GBT more likely to overfit 


svm:
- speed
- bad for messy data
+ ketnel , flexible to choose the form of decision boudaries
+ unique solution since we are optimizing a convex function


adaptive boosting:
+ The output of the other learning algorithms ('weak learners') is combined into a weighted sum that represents the final output of the boosted classifier
- sensitive to noise data and outliers


gaussian naive bayes:
+ requires less data
- assumes class conditional independence, which in reality, dependencies usually exist
